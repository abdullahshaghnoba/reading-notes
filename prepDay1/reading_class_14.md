# Data visualization

## Data visualization is an important aspect of data analysis, as it allows for the effective communication of insights and findings to stakeholders. Using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh, one can create visually appealing and informative graphs, charts, and other visual representations of data.

## What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

### Answer:
### Matplotlib is best suited for creating highly customizable static visualizations, Seaborn is best for statistical visualizations, and Bokeh is best for creating interactive visualizations that can be shared on the web. The choice of library depends on the specific use case and the desired level of interactivity.
### ex:
### 1. a plot of stock prices over time, with custom color-coding and annotations, would be well-suited for Matplotlib.
### 2.  a plot of the distribution of heights in a population, with a kernel density estimate overlaid, would be well-suited for Seaborn.
### 3. a map-based visualization that allows users to explore the distribution of COVID-19 cases in different regions, with interactive filtering and pop-up details, would be well-suited for Bokeh.

## In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

### Answer: 
### 1. Relational plots:
### - scatterplot() creates a scatter plot between two variables
### - lineplot() creates a line plot between two variables
### - relplot() creates a flexible grid of subplots that can be used to create a variety of different types of relational plots.
### 2. Categorical plots:
### - boxplot() and violinplot() create box and violin plots, respectively, which show the distribution of the numerical variable across categories.
### - swarmplot() creates a scatter plot where points do not overlap.
### - barplot() creates a bar chart to show the mean or median of a numerical variable for each category
### - countplot() creates a bar chart to show the count of occurrences of each category. 
### 3. Distribution plots:
### - histplot() creates a histogram of the distribution of the numerical variable.
### - kdeplot() creates a kernel density estimate plot of the distribution.
### - rugplot() creates a rug plot that shows the distribution of individual data points.
