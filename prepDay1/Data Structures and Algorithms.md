# Data Structures and Algorithms Reading

# Python has many built-in data structures, such as lists, sets, and dictionaries, which make it easier to work with data. Understanding how these data structures work and when to use them is important for Python programming.

## What is 1 the most important thing you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem? 

### answer : The problem's requirements, such as the type of data to be stored, the expected size of the data, the operations to be performed on the data, and the performance requirements of the solution.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

### answer : by defining a base case or a condition that breaks out the function

## Things I want to know more about : None
