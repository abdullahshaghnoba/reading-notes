# List Comprehensions and Primer on Decorators
## Overall, understanding list comprehensions and decorators is crucial for any Python developer who wants to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. They are widely used in the Python ecosystem and can help you become a more productive and effective programmer.

### What is the basic syntax of Python list comprehension, and how does it differ from using a for loop to create a list? Provide an example of a list comprehension that squares the elements in a given list of integers?
#### answer:
#### the syntax is like this: new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition] , Using a for loop to create a list requiers initializing an empty list, iterating over the elements of an iterable, and appending each processed element to the list , 
##### example of a list comprehension that squares the elements in a given list of integers:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)

### What is a decorator in Python?
#### answer:
#### a decorator is a special type of function that takes another function as input and extends or modifies its behavior without explicitly changing its source code.

### Explain the concept of decorators in Python. How do they work, and what are some common use cases for them? Provide an example of a simple decorator function from the reading?
#### answer: 
#### In Python, decorators are a way of modifying or extending the behavior of a function without changing its source code. A decorator is a callable object that takes a function as an argument, performs some processing on it, and returns a new function that can be used in place of the original function.

#### Decorators are implemented as functions that wrap other functions. When a decorated function is called, it is actually the wrapper function that is executed, and the wrapper function in turn calls the original function. Decorators are applied to functions using the "@" symbol followed by the decorator function name.

#### Some common use cases for decorators include:

1. #### Logging: Decorators can be used to add logging statements to functions to help with debugging and troubleshooting.

2. #### Caching: Decorators can be used to cache the results of a function to avoid recomputing them every time the function is called.

3. #### Authorization: Decorators can be used to check whether a user is authorized to access a certain function or resource.

4. #### Timing: Decorators can be used to measure the time taken by a function to execute.

#### example of a simple decorator function:
def do_twice(func):
    def wrapper_do_twice():
        func()
        func()
    return wrapper_do_twice

from decorators import do_twice

@do_twice
def say_whee():
    print("Whee!")

say_whee
**output**: 
Whee!
Whee!
