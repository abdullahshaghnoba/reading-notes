# Graphs Data Structure in Python

## Introduction:
Graphs are a fundamental data structure used in computer science and are particularly useful for modeling relationships between objects.

-  What is a Graph?
A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. It can be visualized as a set of interconnected points. Nodes represent entities, while edges represent the relationships between those entities. Graphs can be either directed (edges have a specific direction) or undirected (edges have no specific direction).

- Graph Representation:

Adjacency Matrix , Adjacency List.

- Common Graph Operations:

1. Adding Nodes and Edges.

2. Traversing the Graph.

3. Finding Shortest Paths.

- Implementation Techniques in Python:

1. NetworkX Library.

2. Custom Implementation.

## Conclusion:
Graphs are a versatile data structure used to model relationships and solve various real-world problems.
