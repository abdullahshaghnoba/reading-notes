## How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?

### Answer: Django Forms simplify user input handling in web applications. They provide a way to define form classes with fields and validation rules. Forms are rendered in HTML using built-in template tags and filters. When a form is submitted, Django handles data validation automatically. If the form is valid, the cleaned data can be processed. If the form is invalid, error messages are displayed. Django Forms save development time, ensure data validity, and promote code organization.

## Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability?

### Answer: Django Templates separate the presentation logic from the business logic in web development. They define the structure and layout of web pages while allowing dynamic content insertion. Template inheritance enhances code reusability by creating a base template that other templates can inherit from. This avoids code duplication, modularizes design, customizes pages, and simplifies updates to shared elements. Django Templates improve code organization, promote reusability, and maintainability in web applications.

## Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views?

### Answer: Django Views handle HTTP requests and generate responses in web applications. Function-based views (FBVs) are simple functions that provide flexibility, while class-based views (CBVs) are structured classes that offer code reusability. FBVs are suitable for smaller views, while CBVs provide additional features and organized code.
