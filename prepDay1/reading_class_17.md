## What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?

### Answer: The key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites are that static websites are composed of pre-rendered HTML and are easier to scrape, while dynamic websites rely on JavaScript to render content and may require additional techniques like headless browsers or API calls for effective scraping. Dynamic websites often have interactive elements and load data dynamically, requiring more complex scraping strategies compared to static websites.

## Describe the purpose of using Xpath in web scraping, and provide an example of an Xpath expression to select a specific HTML element from a webpage.

### Answer:
### XPath is a query language used in web scraping to navigate and select elements from HTML or XML documents. It allows you to precisely locate specific elements based on their attributes, structure, or position in the document. For example, to select a specific HTML element using XPath, you can use an expression like "//div[@class='my-class']" to select all div elements with a specific class attribute 'my-class'.
